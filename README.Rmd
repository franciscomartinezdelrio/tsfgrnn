<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of tsfgrnn is to forecast time series using GRNN regression.

## Installation

You can install the released version of tsfgrnn from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("tsfgrnn")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("franciscomartinezdelrio/tsfgrnn")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows how to forecast with tsfgrnn:

```{r example}
library(tsfgrnn)
pred <- grnn_forecasting(USAccDeaths, h = 12)
pred$prediction # To see a time series with the forecasts
plot(pred) # To see a plot with the forecast
```

To know more, read the package's vignette.
